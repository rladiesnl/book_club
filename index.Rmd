## Welcome to R-Ladies Netherlands Book Club &#x1F4DA; &#x1f1f3;&#x1f1f1;!!

R-Ladies chapters from the Netherlands are gathering forces to host online book clubs!

We are very excited to start with the book [**Advanced R**](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.

### What to expect?:

  - Highlight the key points on each topic of the book with a presentation.
  
  - Go together through the exercises.
  
  - Discuss and clarify doubts.
  
   
### When?

The events will be hosted every two weeks by different R-Ladies chapters, on Tuesdays at 6pm, via jitsi.

### Current agenda:

```{r, include = FALSE}

url <- ("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oAzHwL8OMo3AE3994MkYVSPyR9RawZWiwvYDB-nSg-8/edit#gid=0") 
gs4_deauth()

data <- read_sheet(url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = as.character(date)) %>% 
  select(chapter, title, description, speaker, date, hosted_by, link)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data %>% 
filter(!is.na(speaker)) %>% 
  mytable() %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = " white", background = "#562457")
```
