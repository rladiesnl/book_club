# Object-Oriented Programming


- Multiple OOP systems!
    + Today we focus on S3: important for base R! 
    + Others: R6, S4, RC, R.oo, proto...

--

- Why use OOP?
    + Making functions more versatile (same function for different input)
    + Easier to contribute with new *methods* 
    
--

```{r example_oop1}
x_vector <- c(1:15)
print(x_vector)

x_matrix <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 5)
print(x_matrix)
```

---
# Important vocabulary for OOP

- **Types of OOP**  

    + **Encapsulated OOP:** methods belong to objects or classes, and method calls typically look like object.method(arg1, arg2)  
    
    + **Functional OOP:** methods belong to generic functions, and method calls look like ordinary function calls: generic(object, arg2, arg3) **<- S3**
--

- **Generic Function:** the function you actually call
--

- **Method:** the implementation of a generic function for the specific class of your object  
--

- **Method dispatch:** process of finding the correct method given a class

---

```{r fig2, out.width="80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/2_begin.gif")
```
Make sure you have installed and loaded `library(sloop)`

# Objects in R

```{r fig1, out.width="120%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/1_R_objects.png")
```

---
# How to find out if an object is Base or OO?
--

**Base object:**
```{r base_vs_oo1}
sloop::otype(1:10)
attr(1:10, "class")
```
--

**OO object**
```{r base_vs_oo2}
sloop::otype(mtcars)

attr(mtcars, "class")
```


---
# Base Types

Every object has a base type:

```{r basetype}
typeof(1:10)

typeof(mtcars)
```
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

--
> Base types do not form an OOP system because functions that behave differently for different base types are primarily written in C code that uses switch statements. This means that only R-core can create new types

---
# What are the base types? (1/2)

- Vectors:
    + NULL (NILSXP), logical (LGLSXP), integer (INTSXP), double (REALSXP)**, complex (CPLXSXP), character (STRSXP), list (VECSXP), and raw (RAWSXP).

- Functions:
    + Closure (regular R functions, CLOSXP), special (internal functions, SPECIALSXP), and builtin (primitive functions, BUILTINSXP).

- Environments have type environment (ENVSXP).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


--
** Careful with the _"numeric"_ type! It can mean many things in R!

---
# What are the base types? (2/2)

- S4 type (S4SXP) is used for S4 classes that don’t inherit from an existing base type

- Language components
    + Symbol (aka name, SYMSXP), language (usually called calls, LANGSXP), and pairlist (used for function arguments, LISTSXP) types.

- Expression (EXPRSXP) is a special purpose type that’s only returned by parse() and expression(). Expressions are generally not needed in user code.

- Others
    + Externalptr (EXTPTRSXP), weakref (WEAKREFSXP), bytecode (BCODESXP), promise (PROMSXP), ... (DOTSXP), and any (ANYSXP).

# .fancy[Chapter 13: S3]

---
# S3 objects

- Most commonly used system in CRAN packages

- Very flexible! (good and bad)

- At least a class attribute

```{r s3_attributes1}

f <- factor(c("a", "b", "c"))

typeof(f)

```

```{r s3_attributes2}
attributes(f)
```

---
# How does the S3 object 'f' actually look like?

You can remove the "special" behavior of a class:

```{r unclass}
f
unclass(f)
```

---
# Classes

Not as formal as in other languages

```{r create_class}
# Create and assign class in one step
x <- structure(list(), class = "my_class")

# Create, then set class
x <- list()
class(x) <- "my_class"
```

---
**Recommendations:**

- The class name can be any string, but better to use only letters and _
- When using a class in a package, good to include the package name in the class name

S3 has no checks for correctness which means you can change the class of existing objects!

```{r change_class}
y <- matrix(1:10)
class(y)
class(y) <- "my_class"
class(y)
```

---
# Flexibility can be problematic

```{r flexible_problem, error=TRUE}
# Create a linear model 
mod <- lm(log(mpg) ~ log(disp), data = mtcars)
class(mod)

print(mod)

# Turn it into a date
class(mod) <- "Date"
print(mod)

```

---
## Recommendations when creating a class:

Provide three functions:  

1. A constructor, `new_myclass()` <- MOST IMPORTANT!  

2. A validator, `validate_myclass()`  

3. A user-friendly helper, `myclass()`

---
## Constructor

The constructor should follow three principles:

- Be called `new_myclass()`
- Have one argument for the base object, and one for each attribute
- Check the type of the base object and the types of each attribute

```{r factor_constructor}
new_factor <- function(x = integer(), levels = character()) {
  stopifnot(is.integer(x))
  stopifnot(is.character(levels))

  structure(
    x,
    levels = levels,
    class = "factor"
  )
}

new_factor(x = 1:2, levels = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

The constructor is a developer function: it’s OK to trade a little safety in return for performance.

---
# Validators (1/2)

```{r validator_factor, error=TRUE}
validate_factor <- function(x) {
  values <- unclass(x)
  levels <- attr(x, "levels")

  if (!all(!is.na(values) & values > 0)) {
    stop(
      "All `x` values must be non-missing and greater than zero",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }

  if (length(levels) < max(values)) {
    stop(
      "There must be at least as many `levels` as possible values in `x`",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }

  x
}

```
---
# Validators (2/2)

```{r malformed_factors, error = TRUE}
# Without validator
new_factor(1:5, "a")

#With validator
validate_factor(new_factor(1:5, "a"))

```
---
# Helpers

- Created mainly for users  

- A helper should always:  
  + Have the same name as the class, e.g. `myclass()`
  + Finish by calling the constructor, and the validator, if it exists
  + Create carefully crafted error messages tailored towards an end-user
  + Have a thoughtfully crafted user interface with carefully chosen default values and useful conversions  
    - Coerce inputs to the desired type
--

```{r factor_helper_default}
factor <- function(x = character(), levels = unique(x)) {
  ind <- match(x, levels)
  validate_factor(new_factor(ind, levels))
}

factor(x = c("a", "a", "b"))
```

---
# Generics and methods

A **generic function** is an interface that uses **method dispatch** to find the right implementation (**method**) depending on the class of the main argument.  

Every generic calls `UseMethod()` to do _method dispatch_. 

```{r generic_inside}
# In this case, the generic function is 'print'
print
```
--

Methods are named: `generic.class()`
```{r method_dispatch}
s3_dispatch(print(time))
```
---
Creating your own generic is similarly simple:

```{r mygeneric}
my_new_generic <- function(x) {

    UseMethod("my_new_generic")

}
```

**WARNING!** It is not always the case! (think about `t.test`)

---
# Method dispatch

How does `UseMethod()` work?

```{r usemethod}
x <- Sys.Date()
s3_dispatch(print(x))
```
--
```{r usemethod2}
x <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2)
class(x)
s3_dispatch(print(x))
```

---
## Find Methods...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_panelset()
```

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[...for a generic]

```{r find_generic_methods}
s3_methods_generic("mean")
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[...for a class]

```{r find_class_methods}
s3_methods_class("ordered")
```
]
]

---
# Other Object Styles (1/3)

- Record style objects: list of equal-length vectors

```{r record_style}
x <- as.POSIXlt(ISOdatetime(2020, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1:3))
x

length(x)

length(unclass(x))

head(unclass(x), 2)
```

---
# Other Object Styles (2/3)

- Data frames: lists of equal length vectors that are conceptually 2-D. Individual components are exposed to the user

```{r dataframes}
x <- data.frame(x = 1:100, y = 1:100)
nrow(x)
length(x)
unclass(x)
```

---
# Other Object Styles (3/3)

- Scalar objects: use a list to represent a single thing

```{r models}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
mod
length(mod)
#unclass(mod)
```

---
# Inheritance

If a method is not found for the class in the first element of the vector, R looks for a method for the second class (and so on):

```{r inheritance}
s3_dispatch(print(ordered("x")))

s3_dispatch(print(Sys.time()))
```

A method can delegate work by calling `NextMethod()`.

```{r delegation}
s3_dispatch(ordered("x")[1])
```

---
# Other ways of dispatching: Internal generics

Functions that don’t call `UseMethod()` but instead call the C functions `DispatchGroup()` or `DispatchOrEval()`. Examples: `[`, `sum()` and `cbind()` 

```{r internal_generics}
s3_dispatch(Sys.time()[1])
```

---
# Other ways of dispatching: Group generics

Like internal generics, they only exist in base R, and you cannot define your own group generic. Four group generics:

- Math: abs(), sign(), sqrt(), floor(), cos(), sin(), log(), and more

- Ops: +, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%, &, |, !, ==, !=, <, <=, >=, and >

- Summary: all(), any(), sum(), prod(), min(), max(), and range()

- Complex: Arg(), Conj(), Im(), Mod(), Re()

Methods for group generics are looked for only if the methods for the specific generic do not exist:

```{r group_generics1}
s3_dispatch(sum(Sys.time()))

y <- as.difftime(10, units = "mins")
s3_dispatch(abs(y))
```

---
# Double dispatch

Generics in the Ops group, which includes the two-argument arithmetic and Boolean operators like - and &, implement a special type of method dispatch. They dispatch on the type of both of the arguments.

```{r double_dispatch}
date <- as.Date("2017-01-01")
integer <- 1L

date + integer
```

---
Three possible outcomes of this lookup:
1. The methods are the same, so it doesn’t matter which method is used.
2. The methods are different, and R falls back to the internal method with a warning.
3. One method is internal, in which case R calls the other method.

```{r double_dispatch_example}
s3_dispatch(date + integer)
s3_dispatch(integer + date)
```

# .fancy[Exercises]

# Exercise 1 

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]

Describe the difference between `t.test()` and `t.data.frame()`? When is each function called?
]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]

- `t.test()` is a generic function that performs a t-test.
- `t.data.frame()` is a method that gets called by the generic `t()` to transpose data frame input.

Due to R’s S3 dispatch rules, `t.test()` would also get called when `t()` is a applied to an object of class “test”.
]
]

---
# Exercise 2 

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]

What class of object does the following code return? What base type is it built on? What attributes does it use?

```{r ex2}
x <- table(rpois(100, 5))
x
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]

This code returns a “table” object, which is build upon the “integer” type. The attribute “dimnames” is used to name the elements of the integer vector.

```{r ex3}
typeof(x)

attributes(x)
```
]
]

---
# Exercise 3 

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]

Read the documentation for `utils::as.roman()`. How would you write a constructor for this class? Does it need a validator? What would a helper look like?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer-Constructor]

This function transforms numeric input into Roman numbers. This class is built on the “integer” type, which results in the following constructor.

```{r ex3_constructor}
new_roman <- function(x = integer()){
  stopifnot(is.integer(x))
  structure(x, class = "roman")
}
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer-Validator]

The documentation tells us, that only values between 1 and 3899 are uniquely represented, which we then include in our validation function.

```{r ex3_validator}
validate_roman <- function(x) {
  values <- unclass(x)

  if (any(values < 1 | values > 3899)) {
    stop(
      "Roman numbers must fall between 1 and 3899.",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }

  x
}
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer-Helper]

For convenience, we allow the user to also pass real values to a helper function.

```{r ex3_helper, error = TRUE}
roman <- function(x = integer()) {
  x <- as.integer(x)

  validate_roman(new_roman(x))
}

# Test
roman(c(1, 753, 2019))

roman(0)
```

]
]

---
# Exercise 4 

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]

Carefully read the documentation for `UseMethod()` and explain why the following code returns the results that it does. What two usual rules of function evaluation does `UseMethod()` violate?

```{r ex4}
g <- function(x) {
  x <- 10
  y <- 10
  UseMethod("g")
}
g.default <- function(x) c(x = x, y = y)

x <- 1
y <- 1
g(x)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]

If you call `g.default()` directly you get `c(1, 1)` as you might expect. The value bound to x comes from the argument, the value from y comes from the global environment.

```{r ex4_answer}
g.default(x)
```
But when we call `g()` we get `c(1, 10)`:

```{r ex4_answer2}
g(x)
```

This is seemingly inconsistent: why does `x` come from the value defined inside of `g()`, and `y` still come from the global environment? It’s because `UseMethod()` calls `g.default()` in a special way so that variables defined inside the generic are available to methods. The exception are arguments supplied to the function: they are passed on as is, and cannot be affected by code inside the generic.
]
]

---
# Exercise 5 

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Question]

What do you expect this code to return? What does it actually return? Why?

```{r ex5}
generic2 <- function(x) UseMethod("generic2")
generic2.a1 <- function(x) "a1"
generic2.a2 <- function(x) "a2"
generic2.b <- function(x) {
  class(x) <- "a1"
  NextMethod()
}

generic2(structure(list(), class = c("b", "a2")))
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]

When we execute the code above, this is what is happening:

- We pass an object of classes `b` and `a2` to `generic2()`, which prompts R to look for a method `generic2.b()`
- The method `generic2.b()` then changes the class to `a1` and calls `NextMethod()`

One would think that this will lead R to call `generic2.a1()`, but in fact, as mentioned in the textbook,` NextMethod()`

> doesn’t actually work with the class attribute of the object, but instead uses a special global variable (.Class) to keep track of which method to call next.

This is why `generic2.a2()` is called instead.
