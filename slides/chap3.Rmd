## Vectors ##

---

## Outline

- Atomic vectors

- Attributes: names, dimensions, class

- Atomic vectors with special attributes (S3 atomic vectors)

- Lists

- Data frames and tibbles


---

## Atomic vectors 

.pull-left[

- Vectors can be atomic and lists.

- **Atomic** vectors: all elements must have the same type.

- **Lists** can have different types.

- `NULL` serves as a generic zero 

]


.pull-right[<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2ff3a6cebf1bb80abb2a814ae1cfc67b12817713/ae848/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree.png" width="400" >]

---

### Atomic vectors: Scalars

.pull-left[

- Each type has a special sintax to create an individual value, AKA **scalar** 

- Logicals: `TRUE`, `FALSE`

- Doubles: Can be decimals (`0.1234`), scientific (`1.23e4`) or hexadecimal (`0xcafe`), plus special values as `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN` (Not a number.)

- Integers: are followed by `L`

- Strings are surrounded by `""` or `''`

]

]

---

### Atomic vectors: longer vectors

**Combine** = c()

```{r}
lgl_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
```

If input are atomic vectors, `c()` creates another atomic vector

```{r}
c(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))

```

---
<br><br><br>


.pull-left[

`typeof()` 

```{r}
typeof(lgl_var)
```

`length()`

```{r}
length(int_var)
```

]
<br>

.pull-right[<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8a3d360c80da1186b1373a0ff0ddf7803b96e20d/254c6/diagrams/vectors/atomic.png" width="400">]

---

### Atomic vectors: Missing values

- R represents missing values as `NA`: **Not applicable**

.pull-left[
Operations with NA tend to return NAs

```{r, results='hold'}
NA > 5

10 * NA

!NA
```
]

--

.pull-right[

A few exceptions

```{r, results='hold'}
NA ^0

NA | TRUE

NA & FALSE
```

]

---

### Atomic vectors: Missing values

.pull-left[

Propagation of missingness leads to a common mistake

```{r}
x <- c(NA, 5, NA, 10)

x == NA
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Use `is.na()` to test for missingness

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

]

There are four types of missing values:

`NA` (logical), `NA_integer_`, `NA_real` (double), `NA_character`

---

### Atomic vectors: Testing and coercion

- `is*()` functions to test if a vector is of that type.
```{r, results='hold'}
is.integer(x)
is.double(x)
```

- Avoid `is.vector()`, `is.atomic()`, `is.numeric()`.

---

Since **atomic vector** needs **elements** of the same **type**, when we combine different types they are coerced in a fixed order:

.center[character -> double -> integer -> logical]

```{r}
str(c("a", 1))
```

--

Use `as.*()` to deliberately coerce. Failing to coerce creates `NA`

```{r}
as.numeric(c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
as.integer(c("1", "1.5", "a"))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
readr::parse_double(c("1", "1.5", "a"))
```
]

---

## Attributes

Matrices, arrays, factors or date-times are types of vectors that have attributes built on top of atomic vectors.

Name-value pairs of metadata to an object.

```{r}
x <- 'a'
attr(x, 'what') <- 'apple'
attr(x, "what")

```

---
<br><br>

.pull-left[

Get and set multiple attributes with `attributes()` and `structure()`

```{r}
x <- 
  structure('a',
      what = 'apple',
      type = 'fruit')
attributes(x)
```

With the exception of `names()` and `dim()`, most attributes are lost with calculations

---

### Attributes: `names`

Names, a character vector giving each element a name

.pull-left[

```{r eval=T, results='hold'}
x <- c(apple = 'a', banana = 'b') # 1
x

y <- c('a', 'b')
names(y) <- c('apple', 'banana') # 2
y

setNames(y, c('apple', 'banana')) # 3
```

]

---

### Attributes: `dim`

`Dim` attribute to a vector allows it to behave like a 2-dimensional matrix or a multi-dimensional array.

.pull-left[
```{r eval=T}
a <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
a
b <- array(1:6, dim = c(1, 3, 2))
b
```
]

.pull-right[
+ 1-d vector without a `dim` attribute has `NULL` dimension 

+ Matrices and arrays can be a single column or row vector
]

---

## S3 atomic vectors

.pull-left[

An object with a **class** attribute **S3 object** 

It behaves different from a regular vecture when passed through **generic** functions

Usually store additional information

Now we will see:

- `factor` (categorical)

- `Date` (Date)

- `POSIXct` (date-time)

- `duration` (difftime).

]

.pull-right[
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/baa19d0ebf9b97949a7ad259b29a1c4ae031c8e2/8e9b8/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-s3-1.png" width="298" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
]

---

### S3 atomic vectors: Factors

- Vector that can only contain pre-defined value, used to store categorical data.

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1c19eabc59d445cab78fc605053c7393ec630e15/5843b/diagrams/vectors/factor.png" width="246" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

- Built on top of integers, not characters, has two attributes: `class` and `levels`

```{r}
fruits <- factor(c('banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'apple'))
```


.pull-left[
```{r results='hold'}
fruits
typeof(fruits)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
attributes(fruits)
```
]

---
### S3 atomic vectors: Factors

.pull-left[
Factors give counts of all categories, even unobserved ones

```{r, results = 'hold'}
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")

sex_factor <- factor(
  sex_char, 
  levels = c("m", "f"))

table(sex_char)
table(sex_factor)

```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Ordered** factors: the order of the levels is meaningful.
```{r}
x <- ordered(
  c('two', 'three', 'one'), 
  levels = c('one', 'two', 'three'))
x
```
]

---
### S3 atomic vectors: Factors

- In base R, `read.csv` and `data.frame` automatically converted character vectors to factors.

- This is suboptimal: use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

- Since they are built in integers, be carefull to treat them as strings.

- `gsub()` and `grepl` coerce factors to strings.

- [Interesting story about `stringsAsFactors`](https://simplystatistics.org/2015/07/24/stringsasfactors-an-unauthorized-biography/)

---

### S3 atomic vectors: Date

All built on top of doubles

Dates have `class = "Date"`

```{r, results = 'hold'}
today <- Sys.Date()

typeof(today)

attributes(today)
```

Represents: days since Jan. 1, 1970

```{r}
date <- as.Date("1970-02-01")
unclass(date)
```

---

### S3 atomic vectors: POSIXct, duration

POSI: Portable Operating System Interface

ct: calendar time / it: local time

POSIXct: Seconds since Jan. 1, 1970

```{r, results = 'hold'}
now_ct <- as.POSIXct("2018-08-01 22:00", tz = "UTC")
now_ct

typeof(now_ct)

attributes(now_ct)
```

`tzone` only changes format, not the instant time represented by a vector.

---

### S3 atomic vectors: duration

Represent the amount of time between paris of dates or date-times

Are built on top of doubles, have a `units` attribute that determines how the integer should be interpreted.

```{r}
week <- as.difftime(8, units = "weeks")
week

typeof(week)

attributes(week)

```

---

## Lists

.pull-left[
Elements can be of any type.

But each element of a list has the same type, because each element is a _reference_ to another object.

That means that creating a list does not copy the components into the list (smaller size)


<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9628eed602df6fd55d9bced4fba0a5a85d93db8a/36c16/diagrams/vectors/list.png" width="350">

]

--

.pull-right[
`list()`

```{r}
l1 <- list(
  1:3, 
  "a", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)

typeof(l1)


str(l1)
```
]

---

.pull-left[
Lists are sometimes called recursive vectors because a list can contain other lists.

```{r}
l3 <- list(list(list(1)))
str(l3)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

c() combines several lists into one.

```{r, results = 'hold'}
l4 <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(l4)

l5 <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(l5)
```

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/eb81c70723664f0920d0fd414e3f326b9ad1fa6e/c06ae/diagrams/vectors/list-c.png" width="241">
]

---

### Lists: Testing and coercion

Test with `is.list()` and coerce with `as.list`()

```{r}
list(1:3)

as.list(1:3)

```


`unlist()` turns a list into an atomic vector

---

### Lists: Matrices and arrays

With atomic vectors, dimension is used to create matrices. With lists, the dimension attribute is used to create list-matrices or list-arrays.

Useful for spatio-temporal grids.

```{r}
l <- list(1:3, "a", TRUE, 1.0)

dim(l) <- c(2, 2)

l

l[[1, 1]]

```

---

## Data frames and tibbles

A data frame is a named list of vectors with attributes for (column) `names`, `row.names` and its class is `data.frame`

.pull-left[
S3 vectors built on top of lists

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9ec5e1f8982238a413847eb5c9bbc5dcf44c9893/bc590/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-s3-2.png" width="160">
]

.pull-right[

The length of each of its vectors must be the same (rectangular)

Has `rownames()` and `colnames()`, the `names()` are the column names

Has `nrow()` and `ncol()`, `length()` gives number of columns

]

---

Some features of data frames create frustrations, which lead to the creation of **tibbles**, which _do less and complain more_.


```{r, result = 'hold'}
df <- data.frame(col1 = 1:2, col2 = c('a', 'b'))
df

class(df$col2)
```

```{r}
tbl <- tibble::tibble(col1 = 1:2, col2 = c('a', 'b'))
tbl
class(tbl$col2)
```

---

### Data frame vs tibble behavior


+ Tibble don't coerce strings to factors by default

--

+ Tibbles discourage rownames, which are generally "bad"

Rownames are "bad" because: (1) storing metadata in a different way than the rest of the data is generally not a good idea; (2) only work if a row can be identified by a single string; (3) must be unique.

--

+ Tibbles have a "prettier" print method

--

+ Tibbles have stricter subsetting rules

--

+ Tibbles always return a tibble and don't allow partial matching with `$`

---

### Data frames and tibbles, testing and coercing

```{r}
is.data.frame(df)

is.data.frame(tbl)

tibble::is_tibble(df)

tibble::is_tibble(tbl)
```

You can coerce with `as.data.frame()` or with `as_tibble()`

---

### List columns

We can put any object in a data frame

We need to either add the list-column after creation or wrapping the list in `I()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)

df$y <- list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)

data.frame(
  x = 1:3, 
  y = I(list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)))
```

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/468ff533e993123c164eb090aa365e33962403bf/28ba7/diagrams/vectors/data-frame-list.png" width="189">
]

.pull-right[

```{r}
tibble::tibble(
  x = 1:3, 
  y = list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)
)
```

]

We can also have a matrix or array as a column in a data frame

---

## `NULL`

NULL is special because it has a unique type, is always length zero, and can’t have any attributes

.pull-left[
```{r, result = 'hold', error = TRUE}
typeof(NULL)

length(NULL)

x <- NULL
attr(x, "y") <- 1
```
]

.pull-right[

- Test for NULLs with is.null()

- Use it to represent an empty vector of arbitrary type

- To represent an absent vector. `NULL` is often as a default function argument.
