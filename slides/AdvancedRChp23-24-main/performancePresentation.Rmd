# We can improve only the things we can measure
Profiling tools can tell us:
- How much time we spent on what portion of the code
- How much memory are we using
- Do we have short-lived variables? (lots of calls to the garbage collector, gc)
- Between many options, which one is more performing?

---

# But... is the improvement worth the effort?
- Don't spend too much time on code that will run only once and never ever will see the light again

- Be realistic: How many times this code will run? Will there really be an impact?

- How big might be the difference between approaches? 

- Don't sacrifice maintainability for a few microseconds

Ok, it is worth the effort. So how do we start?

# Organize the code in a different way (but don't forget your unit tests!) or look for alternatives

- Use `testthat` to ensure that refactoring does not break your code, and if it does, make sure you catch it early!!!

- Twitter, github, stackoverflow might be good sources to find solutions to similar problems

# Vectorize your code

Don't think of scalars (individual elements); think about vectors (entire arrays)

- Avoid loops; better use `map` and friends from `purrr` or the `apply` family (they still have loops, but they are written in C instead of R)

- Vectors are on your side:
```{r eval=FALSE}
x[is.na(x)] <- 0
```
is much faster than writing a for loop with an if statement.

---

# Use specific functions for specific object types
```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(1e5), ncol = 100)
bmres <- bench::mark(
  rowSums = rowSums(x),
  apply = apply(x, 1, sum)
)
```

---

```{r}
bmres[c("expression", "min", "median", "itr/sec", "n_gc")]

```


---
```{r}
plot(bmres)
```

---

# Make your life easier passing more arguments

Suppose we have a medium size data frame that has been written to a file. It has different types of columns
```{r}
x <- data.frame(a = runif(1e5), 
                b = sample(LETTERS, 1e5, replace = TRUE), 
                c = sample(seq(1, 100), 1e5, replace =TRUE), 
                d = sample(letters, 1e5, replace = TRUE),
                e = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1e5, replace = TRUE))
write.csv(x, "outfile.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

---

We can speed-up read.csv if we tell R what data types are in the columns
```{r}
mbres <- microbenchmark(
  no_extra_args = read.csv("outfile.csv"),
  with_extra_args = read.csv("outfile.csv", 
            colClasses = c("numeric", "character", 
                           "integer", "character", 
                           "logical"))
)
```

---

```{r}
mbres
```

---
```{r}
boxplot(mbres)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
unlink("outfile.csv")
```

# Use specific libraries for your specific problem

- Big data.frames? Maybe data.table could help 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html

- Distributed data.frames? You can take a look at Sparkr 
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html

Do you have other needs? You can ask plenty of people!

# Telling R the expected output makes it better for you.
For example, if you know that you expect a vector, use directly `vapply` instead of the general wrapper `sapply` 

```{r}

i39 <- sapply(3:9, seq)

bmres <- bench::mark(
  check = FALSE,
  sapply = sapply(i39, fivenum),
  vapply = vapply(i39, fivenum,
       c(Min. = 0, "1st Qu." = 0, Median = 0, "3rd Qu." = 0, Max. = 0))
)
```

---

```{r}
bmres[c("expression", "min", "median", "itr/sec", "n_gc")]
```


---
```{r}
plot(bmres)
```

# Avoid copies (beware copy on modify)

```{r}
size <- 100

dontdothis <- function(size){
  res <- c()
  for (i in seq(size)) {
    res <- c(res, i)

  return(res)
}

dothis<-function(size){
  res <- vector(length = size)
  for (i in seq(size)) {
    res[i] <- i
  }
  return(res)
}

bmres <- bench::mark(
  dontdothis = dontdothis(size),
  dothis = dothis(size)
)

```

```{r}
bmres[c("expression", "min", "median", "itr/sec", "n_gc")]
```

# And that's it!

- Don't forget to ask other people!

- You can also rewrite bottlenecks in C++ (using `Rcpp`)
